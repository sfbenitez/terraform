openstack-debian-ansible
========================

Ansible playbooks for installing OpenStack Newton on Debian stretch using debian official repos. The steps taken follow a standard OpenStack deployment: [OpenStack Installation Guide for Ubuntu](http://docs.openstack.org/newton/install-guide-ubuntu/) with some minors modifications to use with Debian.

The deployment schema selected is ["Classic with OpenvSwitch"](http://docs.openstack.org/mitaka/networking-guide/scenario-classic-ovs.html), instead of using linux bridges as explained in OpenStack Installation Guide.

These playbooks have been written with the idea of using them in a real deployment
with physical servers, but thay can be used too to deploy a OpenStack test
environment with vagrant.

**IMPORTANT: This is still a work in progress, feel free to open issues on github**

## Software used (specific versions):

- Debian GNU/Linux: stretch (amd64). 
- Linux kernel: 4.9.0-4-amd64
- Open vSwitch: 2.6.2
- OpenStack: Newton
- Ansible: 1.7.2
- Vagrant: 1.8.6
- VirtualBox: 5.0.24

## OpenStack componens included:

Keystone, Glance, Nova, Neutron, Horizon, Cinder and Heat

## Get a debian jessie vagrant box:

Tested using an unofficial debian stretch vagrant box available at (use it at your own risk or create your own vagrant box):

    https://atlas.hashicorp.com/remram/boxes/debian-9-amd64

You can download and install it locally with:

    vagrant box add remram/debian-9-amd64

If you are going to use these playbooks with physical serves, ignore the
Vagranfile and configure ansible.cfg properly.

## Configuration

![schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iesgn/openstack-debian-ansible/master/img/openstack-debian-ansible.png)

The file *groups_var/all* contains all variables needed by ansible playbooks and
they can be customized if needed. It's **mandatory** to define the following
variables according to your LAN:

    controller_external_ip: 192.168.1.101
	storage_external_ip: 192.168.1.101
	network_node_external_ip: 192.168.1.101
	network_node_external_netmask: 255.255.255.0
	network_node_external_CIDR: 24
	external_gateway: 192.168.1.1

The Vagranfile must be modified too:

    controller.vm.network :public_network, bridge: "wlan0" ,ip: "192.168.1.101" # eth2 external

## Bring up the scenario (vagrant insecure private key is not used in recent vagrant releases, so the first step is not needed)

    chmod 400 vagrant_private_key
	vagrant up

## Run ansible playbooks to configure the cloud

    ansible-playbook site-aio.yml -s

## Using OpenStack

Open your browser and type in the notification bar http://192.168.1.201 or the corresponding external IP chosen.
